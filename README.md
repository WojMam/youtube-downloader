## Description

This project was created to enable fast download of ≈ÅuczniczQA's meetup youtube channel videos.

After changing the hardcoded links it can be used to download any Yt video with given quality.

## Plan for the future:

- Full refactor
- Links in the seperate file, not hardcoded in the code
- Possibility to put you own link in the command line
- GUI?
